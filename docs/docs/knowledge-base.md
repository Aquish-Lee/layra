# Knowledge Base

LAYRA's RAG system provides **visual-native document understanding** with layout-aware retrieval and processing. To enable RAG functionality, you need to create a knowledge base and upload documents before starting conversations in the RAG-CHAT module. This guide covers how to create and manage your knowledge base.

## Create a Knowledge Base

### Step 1: Select the Knowledge Base Module
When no knowledge base is selected, the main area on the right displays all uploaded documents from all knowledge bases. You can search for specific documents using the search box, which supports fuzzy search.

## Uploading Documents

LAYRA supports **50+ file formats** including PDF, DOCX, PPTX, DOC, etc. To upload:

1. Select your newly created knowledge base to access its document page
2. Upload files in batches by either:
   - Clicking the **Upload Files** button (supports multi-file selection), or
   - Dragging-and-dropping multiple files into the upload zone

:::important NOTE
The system will process all files **in parallel**, with the **maximum number of concurrent instances** determined by the `UNOSERVER_INSTANCES` setting in the `.env` file **and** the available GPU resources. Progress will be displayed as a percentage.

The progress percentage is calculated by **file count**. For example:
- 4 documents: 0% → 25% → 50% → 75% → 100%
- 1 document: 0% → 100%
