# Basic Concepts

LAYRA's **Agent Workflow Engine** enables you to build arbitrarily complex AI automation pipelines through intuitive visual programming. This section introduces fundamental concepts before you start creating your own workflows.

---

## Understanding Agent Workflows

An **Agent Workflow** is a sequence of interconnected nodes that defines:

1. **Multi-step AI processes** combining LLM reasoning, data operations, and action execution
2. **Custom logic flows** with conditional branches, loops, and human interaction points
3. **Context-aware operations** that maintain state throughout execution

Unlike RAG systems, workflows handle **stateful operations** where outputs from one node dynamically become inputs to subsequent nodes.

## Essential Components

### 1. Nodes

![Workflow Node Architecture](./img/workflow-nodes.png)

The foundational building blocks of all workflows. Each node type serves a distinct purpose:

- **Start Nodes**: Define workflow entry points
- **LLM Nodes**: Handle all large language model operations including text generation, decision-making, MCP execution, function calls, RAG integration, and chatflow I/O
- **Code Nodes**: Execute Python scripts with pip package support, network access, and full native Python capabilities (with security safeguards)
- **Condition Nodes**: Create decision branches (if/else logic)
- **Loop Nodes**: Enable repetitive operations (for/while loops)

:::important Why Only Five Node Types?

- LAYRA maintains a minimalist design philosophy for enhanced accessibility while preserving powerful extensibility
- Users can unlock unlimited potential through Python scripting in code nodes and LLM parameter tuning
- Custom nodes can be developed and published by advanced users
- Beginners can leverage official templates for zero-code development

### 2. Connections

Define data flow between nodes through:

- **Input/Output Ports**: Data transfer interfaces on nodes
- **Connection Lines**: Visual links representing execution paths

### 3. Global Variables

**Persistent storage for workflow data:**  
Supports all Python-defined variable types, enabling complex operations in code nodes for maximum development flexibility. Moreover, global variables can store LLM outputs through direct assignment (advanced "magic" assignment features will be explored in later sections).

```python
# Access context anywhere in your workflow
input = 10  # integer
tourist_destination = "MeiZhou_island"  # string
square_numbers = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]  # list
animals = {"species": ["dog", "cat", "bird"]}  # dictionary
...
```

## Create Your First LAYRA Workflow

Just as every programmer begins with "Hello World", your LAYRA journey starts with printing "Hello LAYRA". Follow these three simple steps:

1. **Build the Flow**  
   From the left node panel:

   - Drag a `start` node onto the canvas
   - Add a `code` node  
     Connect the `start` node's output port to the `code` node's input port

2. **Implement Your Logic**  
   Select the `code` node and navigate to the `Code Editor` tab:

   ```python
   print("Hello LAYRA!")
   ```

   Click the `Run` button in the canvas toolbar

3. **Verify Execution**  
   Wait for the `Execution Succeeded` notification. Check the `Output` panel:
   ```
   Hello LAYRA!
   ```
   ðŸŽ‰ **Congratulations!** You've built your first LAYRA workflow!
