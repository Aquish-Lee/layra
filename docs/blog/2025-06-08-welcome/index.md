## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to LAYRA!

To all new explorers joining us: **Welcome aboard!** You're about to experience a fundamentally new approach to AI automation. Whether you're building document processors, agent workflows, or experimenting with visual AI, we've designed LAYRA to be:

- **Instant to start** - Single-command Docker deployment
- **Open to all** - Apache 2.0 licensed and community-driven
- **Ready to extend** - Python-powered workflows from day one

## Why I Built a Visual-First AI Revolution

As a developer working with document AI systems, I kept hitting the same frustrating walls:

1. **Layout amnesia** - Traditional RAG systems would shred beautiful documents into unstructured text, destroying tables, diagrams, and visual hierarchy
2. **Workflow paralysis** - Existing "AI agents" couldn't handle complex nested logic, human-in-the-loop, or real Python execution
3. **OCR blindness** - Critical visual context got lost in translation between pixels and tokens

The breaking point came when I watched an AI system completely misinterpret a financial report because it couldn't:
- Preserve tabular relationships
- Recognize handwritten annotations
- Understand the semantic flow between diagrams and text

That's when I realized: **AI needs to see like humans to think like humans.** So I built LAYRA - the world's first visual-native AI agent engine.
